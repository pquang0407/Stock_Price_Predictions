# Stock_Price_Predictions
This repository contains code and models for predicting stock prices. The goal is to forecast future stock prices based on historical data and relevant features. Below are the key components of this project:
  Stock price predictions from files in datasets: "FPT.csv", "MSN.csv", "PNJ.csv", "VIC.csv"
**Dataset**
The dataset used for training and evaluation consists of historical stock price data.
Features include stock prices, trading volume, and other relevant financial indicators.
Data preprocessing steps are applied to clean and prepare the dataset for modeling.
**Models**
  **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory):** A recurrent neural network architecture suitable for time series data.
